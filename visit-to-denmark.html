			<h2>1. Museums and art galleries</h2>
			<p>Denmark has a long list of museums and art galleries that cover various art movements and eras. From the Danish Golden Age and contemporary art to Vikings’ society and sailors’ lives, culture buffs certainly have much to add to their to-see list before visiting the coolest country in Scandinavia. Even though Copenhagen’s and Aarhus’ culture scene stand out, visitors will find museums or art galleries that display unique masterpieces in many Danish cities. They may not be as impressive as The National Gallery of Denmarks or ARoS Aarhus Museum, but they certainly captivate your interest. </p>

			<h2>2. Renaissance castles and modern architecture buildings</h2>
			<p>Renaissance palaces and Baroque castles standing since the time mighty kings ruled the country and modern architecture buliding of the 21st century create Denmark’s elegant and diverse façade. Every corner presents the country’s long history through these remarkable buildings whose architectural style and interior design showcase the different eras and periods the country went through. Meanwhile, refined buildings with a modern-architectural style add a modern and stylized note. Check out the Frederiksborg Palace north of Copenhagen, Fredensborg Palace, and definitely don’t miss visiting Kronborg Castle, also known as Hamlet’s Castle and Shakespeare’s source of inspiration for the world-famous drama. For modern-architecture lovers, the Royal Danish Opera, the royal library in Copengagen, and the peculiar apartment building known as the Iceberg in Aarhus are must-visits.</p>

			<h2>3.You can bike everywhere</h2>
			<p>Denmark is one of the most ideal destinations for biking. Not only it is flat, but the country has a great infrastructure with long bike routes and special designed cycle bridges. Rent a bike while visiting, and explore the best sights and every hidden corner. Due to the country’s small size, it is also quite easy to make a bike trip and discover a neighboring city. With numerous campsites along the way, stop to take a break and mingle with other bike and nature lovers. </p>

			<h2>4.A Mecca for fashionistas</h2>
			<p>In the past few years, Scandinacian-style pieces have been dominating catwalks all around the globe while internationally-renowned Dane designers have been taking over the fashion world. Danes know style, period. With Copenhagen at top of the list, cities all over the country have a wide range of fancy-clothing stores with unique pieces that every fashionista would love to add to their collection. Aside from famous designers’—such as Mad Norgaard and Henrik Vibskov—boutiques in Copenhagen, the country brims with elegant shops for all styles and ages as well as secondhand and vintage stores.</p>

			<h2>5. Danes know good music</h2>
			<p>Music aficionados should definitely visit Denmark during the summer when the country brims with music festivals. NorthSide in Aarhus, Nibe Festival in northern Jutland, and Copenhell Festival in Copenhagen are only some of the music festivals and events that take place throughout the summer. Moreover, one of the largest music festivals in Europe, Roskilde, takes place every summer and attracts thousands of locals and tourists. World-famous bands and emerging artists take the nine stages and for four days, music spills out from morning until night. For those visiting Denmark in the winter, events take place throughout the year, and winter travelers can always find a smoky-jazz bar filled with saxophone tunes. </p>

			<h2>6.Go beer tasting</h2>
			<p>Danes’ love for beer is an unquestionable fact. You’ll see them holding little cans while relaxing in a green-grass park, when riding their bikes, or while waiting for the next round to be served. Who could blame them? Denmark has a great beer industry with Carlsberg as well as many other microbreweries producing all types of the beloved drink. No matter the city, local bars serve such a great variety of beer that choosing the right one can sometimes turn out to be quite a difficult task.</p>

			<h2>7.Swim in the summer and ice skate on frozen lakes in the winter </h2>
			<p>Picturesque canals, lakes with white swans strolling around, and sandy beaches create the country’s beautiful and peaceful scenery. For locals, water has become a part of their daily habits year round. During the winter when lakes freeze, Danes grab their skates and practice their skills; and in the hot-summer days, they head straight to the canals for some refreshing dives. Those wanting to experience Denmark like a local, make sure to add in some water activities. Take a boat tour and explore a city from the water, rent a pedal boat and stroll around with swans, or find the best spot for a refreshing plunge.</p>

			<h2>8.Experience a snowy winter</h2>
			<p>Adventure tourism is not something that one would associate with Japan, but the truth is that you can find many exciting experiences in this country. Whether it is snowboarding or skiing in Hokkaido or Nagano or cycling along the Seto Inland sea, catching a glimpse of Mount Fuji from the rollercoasters of FujiQ Highlands or sand-boarding in Japan's desert of Tottori,  the options for thrill-seekers are endless. With about 75% of Japan covered in mountainous landscape you can embark on some amazing multi-day hikes or walk the steps of ancient pilgrimage routes like the Kumano Kodo Trail or the Shikoku 88 Temoles Pilgrimage and witness the perfect mixture of nature and culture. At many tourist spots like Arashiyama or Asakusa you can also actively explore the area while riding a traditional Japanese rickshaw.</p>

			<p>he tranquil and peaceful atmosphere of the country is one of the reasons that Denmark is so special. Most visitors are surprised to notice that life in the city doesn’t necessarily mean traffic jams, car horns, and stressed people quickly moving. Here, life runs in a different rhythm.

It’s not without reason they have ranked first in the UN World Happiness Report (WHR) three times. So, get a glimpse of how it feels to live in one of the world’s happiest nations. </p>

			<h2>10. See the exact spot two different seas meet</h2><p>Travel to North Jutland and experience a unique-natural phenomenon.
