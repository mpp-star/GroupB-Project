		<h2 style="color: #5693C9; text-align: left;">Visiting the capital-Yangon</h2>
		<h3 style="color: #5693C9; text-align: justify;">If you’re planning to visit this country, I suggest you go as soon as possible. Every year there are more and more tourists, meaning the authenticity of the country is getting lost. The country is known for smiling people, as no matter how difficult their life is, they keep smiling whenever possible. First contact with the people is already in the international airport of the capital Yangon, where taxi drivers swarm you upon exit. As I knew how much a fare would cast, I was haggling for the price which was realistic. Landing in Yangon you should take a taxi is the nearest bus is 15 minutes walking away. Following a friend’s advice and also Lonely Planet, I took a three hour train trip around the capital. I asked an elderly man on the street, where the rail station was and he walked with me for 20 minutes to show it to me. About an hour later, when the train arrived, the man returned to the station to check, if I was on the right train. He was really happy, although the communication was only with hands and smile. Smiling is the best way to communicate in Myanmar. The ride showed me the life of local people. I got in touch with them. Also there is food sold on trains, as well as drink and other things. On stations, however, you can also buy live chicken or other feathered animals. A view out the window is full of interesting sites.</h3>

		<h2 style="color: #5693C9; text-align: left;">The Shwedagon pagoda</h2>
		<h3 style="color: #5693C9; text-align: justify;">The biggest attraction of the capital is the Shwedagon pagoda, known as the grand pagoda Dagon, or also as the golden pagoda. It’s the holiest of Buddhist pagodas in Myanmar and many believe it holds relics of four previous Buddhas of the current kalp. A kalp is the time period of the world, used as the basic year count. Each kalp has four periods: the beginning of the world, the being of the world, the downfall of the world and chaos. All four periods make up one mahakalpa – the grand kalpa. The Shwedagon pagoda was made between 6th and 10th century. The legend says it’s over 2600 years old and should be the oldest Buddhist stupa in the world. According to the tradition Taphusa and Bhalika – two brothers, merchants – from the city of Balkh (in modern day Afghanistan) met lord Gautama Buddha, when he was still alive and got as a gift 8 locks of his hair. The reached Burma by the help of the local ruler – king Okalapa – who helped them find the Singutara hill, where the relics of the previous Gautama Buddha were stored. When the king opened the golden casket with the hair of Buddha mystic things started happening. From 16th century forth the pagoda became the most famous Buddhist place of pilgrimage in Siam and it remained such to this day. In 2013 US president Barack Obama visited the Shwdagon pagoda along with Hillary Clinton and met there the Nobel peace prize winner Aung San Su Chi. During my visit there were several political manifestation taking place, as there were presidential elections on November 8th. These were the first free election after 25 years of country’s isolation. It was Aung San Su Chi that was the strongest opposition candidate against the leading democratic party NLD. After the vote count Aung San Su Chi gained 70% of all votes and got the majority in the parliament. She was in house arrest for 15 years and was released to freedom on November 13th 2010.</h3>

		<h2 style="color: #5693C9; text-align: left;">Lake Inle</h2>
		<h3 style="color: #5693C9; text-align: justify;">Simon and I took the night bus from the capital and headed on a 13 hour long drive towards the city of Nyaung Shwe, which is the starting point to see the famous lake Inle. The 22 kilometre long lake is famous for the special way of fishing, where the fishermen stand on one leg and maneuverer the boat with the other. When they see tourists they start posing and a fisherman later demanded 1 dollar for the photos. As I’m not in a habit of giving people money, I gave him a shirt I was planning to give to somebody on the street. The lake is fairy tale like. People live in floating villages, with floating vegetable gardens, going fishing in their wooden crafts. You can rent a bicycle in every hotel and that’s probably the best way to explore the lake shore. The price for rental is around 1.400 kyat per day – which is an equivalent of about one Euro. There are around 70.000 people called Inta, that live around and on the lake, where there are four cities, many villages and floating settlements. The whole area is in the Nyaung Shwe county, where Inta form the majority, with some other people as well: Shan, Taundjo, Pa-O (Taungtu), Danu, Kajah, Danav and Bamar. Most of them are pious Buddhists living in humble wooden cottages on pikes, or in bamboo shacks. Mostly they are self-sufficient farmers. The lake district is also known for the weaving industry. The Shan bags, used mostly for shopping around the country are mostly made here. Weaving silk is an important part of economy and they’re making high quality silk products with recognisable design, known as Inle longyi.</h3>
